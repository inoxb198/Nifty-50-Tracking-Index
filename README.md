Investing in an index fund like the Nifty 50 offers broad market exposure, but sometimes it’s preferable to hand-pick a smaller
group of stocks from that fund. The goal? To match (or even outperform) the returns of the index without buying into all of its
constituents. This project explores a way to do just that by using a tailored variation of Adaptive Elastic Net (AENet), designed
specifically for selecting a smaller set of stocks that still aligns with the index’s performance.My approach takes some of the best
features of regression techniques—like Linear Regression, Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, and Elastic Net (Enet) regression—and rolls them into a single, adaptive method. I introduce a coordinate-wise closed-form update rule, allowing efficient solutions to the optimization problem and enabling a portfolio that keeps pace with the index, without mirroring every stock in it. This method opens up new possibilities for targeted, cost-effective investing that doesn’t sacrifice performance.

The above method when Backtested on Nifty 50 over the last 14 years starting from 1st Jan 2010 to 1st July 2024 on average gives 14% Annual Return.
